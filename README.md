## Overview
**GenSolve** is a machine learning project aimed at providing personalized exercise recommendations based on genetic and symptomatic data. By leveraging LSTM models, the project identifies the best exercises tailored to an individual's genetic predispositions and physical conditions.

This repository contains scripts, datasets, and instructions for preprocessing data, training the predictive model, and evaluating its performance. The system integrates information on genetic disorders, associated symptoms, and their effects on physical fitness to provide effective exercise suggestions.

## Project Components

### Scripts
1. **`preprocess.py`**
   - Cleans, encodes, and formats datasets containing genetic data, symptoms, and exercise details.
   - Ensures consistency across datasets by handling missing values and standardizing formats.
   - Creates features required for effective model training.

2. **`train.py`**
   - Loads preprocessed data and constructs an LSTM-based neural network model.
   - Trains the model to predict suitable exercises based on genetic and symptomatic input.
   - Saves the trained model for future use.

3. **`test.py`**
   - Evaluates the trained model's performance using test datasets.
   - Generates predictions and computes performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Datasets
- **Genetic Data**: Individual-specific genetic profiles used as inputs for training and testing.
- **Symptoms Dataset**: Maps symptoms to genetic disorders, forming part of the feature set.
- **Exercises Dataset**: Catalogs exercises with their associated muscle groups and benefits.
- **Disorders Folder**: Comprehensive repository detailing genetic disorders, symptoms, and their health impacts.
